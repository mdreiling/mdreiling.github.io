      <p id="bioText">My name is Marshall Dreiling and I am an aspiring web developer and graphic designer. I graduated with my Industrial Design degree from Philadelphia University in 2011. I graduated with my MBA one year later from the same school. From 2011-2014 I worked a number of jobs including freelance design work for start-ups, teaching CAD and Design at Philadelphia University, and I was a sales associate at a store that sold only sustainable products. 
        <br><br>
        In 2014 I moved to Richmond to take a job at AIA Virginia. During my time at AIA Virginia I was responsible for organizing and running educational events for architecture professionals. This included organizing everything from hour long lunch and learns, year long programs that moved around the state, and an 800 person conference and product expo. For two years of this time I was also the Education Manager for the Branch Museum for Architecture and Design where I designed exhibitions for the Museum. I have recently started my own studio, <i>One of Three Studio</i>, and am now participating in the University of Richmond Bootbamp.
        <br><br>
        I am the eldest of three children and was born to two architects in Roanoke, Virginia. I lived in Roanoke until I was in 5th grade and then moved to Northern Virginia. I am a passionate sports fan and enjoy playing whatever sport I can. I enjoy playing both video and board games. I am always looking for good food or beer and love to explore Richmond to find them.  </p>
